Do stuff when a removable storage medium is inserted.

This software enables you to run actions on per-file or per-disk basis when a removable drive is added to the system. Optionally you may filter by file extension or storage name/label. While written with movie/video production in mind, you might use this for other stuff too (see below)

Some possible use cases:

- Create an index whenever a medium is inserted.
- Scan a medium for malicious files.
- Create proxy video files for every mov on the medium
- Backup all txt files on HOMEWORK medium to dropbox
